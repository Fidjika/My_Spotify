        "bio": "The music of Abbas Premjee spans many genres, from rock and blues to world and classical.\n\nAbbas has had an undeniable passion for music since an early age. He started playing guitar at 10 and remained largely self-taught until the time he began to formally study music. During his initial years, he played guitar for several rock and jazz bands. It was during this time that he was exposed to classical guitar, which led him to decide to study music formally.\n\nHe completed his Bachelors degree in Music theory and composition from Loyola Marymount University, and then his Masters degree in Classical Guitar from Southern Methodist University, where he studied under Robert Guthrie. A few years later, he returned to Pakistan and opened a recording studio and production house, working with local talent and producing music for TV. As Abbas later realized, coming back to Pakistan was an essential step in his musical growth as it led to his discovery of Indian Classical music. Here he found a world rich in expression. A world unknown to his Western ears. Keen to learn this new language, he took up the Mohan veena, a modern hybrid between a guitar and a sitar, and took instruction in from the legendary sitar player, Ustad Rais Khan.\n\nHaving lived the life of a classical musician on both sides of the fence, and as a rock and jazz musician earlier, Abbas thought of a world where all these expressions could live together. This led to his first CD \"Elements\", on which he collaborated with some of the finest talent in Pakistan. \"Elements\" was released in Pakistan in 2008. It was met with great enthusiasm and very positive reviews in some of the leading newspapers, vastly increasing the scope of music available to the people of Pakistan and introducing them to the subtleties of jazz and classical guitar built on ragas and drones. This was followed by the release of \"Crescent Moon\" in 2011, in which he featured the Mohan veena. Both these albums successfully combined the beauty and grace of the ragas with contemporary sounds and grooves from the rock and jazz genres.\n\nIn 2009, Abbas returned to the United States and has since taken up residence in Irvine, CA where he is active as a composer for media, a teacher, as well as a performer on the mohan veena.",

            "description": "Each track on this album has been written with the help of Indian ragas: scalar and melodic patterns that convey distinct essences of emotions. To this, I have added sounds of rock, jazz and whatever else that came in my mind. The combination works.\n\nA host of influences have converged here ranging from the ancient sounds of Indian ragas to contemporary hip-hop beats. The result is sometimes hypnotic and sometimes melancholic. Our ancestors had a much deeper connection with music than we do, on a spiritual and emotional level. I would like to reestablish that connection.\n\nCrescent Moon features the mohan veena, a modern version of an ancient Indian instrument. The mohan veena, being a slide instrument, possesses the ability to play microtonally and bring out the true nature of the ragas.\n\n",

Although originally being more interested in computer programming than music, this dabbling with music would later go from being a mere hobby to becoming a passion for all things musical.\n\nAlthough Adam's earlier tracks were geared more towards industrial and VGM styles while taking an interest in metal and post-hardcore music, his style would later evolve to encompass a wide variety of sub-genres including dance, ambient, synthpop, downtempo, breaks and neo-classical styles while retaining his unique production style and melodic focus. While studying as a music production student at the University of Huddersfield, Adam began to experiment with incorporating vocals and guitar elements into his music proper, with the former becoming a key element in many of his songs.\n\nAdam has also used his writing and production skills in other projects, including sound design and freelance composition projects for various companies as well as having his music licensed by various firms and individuals. Adam has also worked on various collaborations and remixes with other like-minded musicians.\n\nVisit Adam Fielding on the web at www.adamfielding.com.",

Completing studies at Western Michigan University and a Professional Music Training Diploma from Vancouver Community College, he studied lute repertoire and technique in London, England at the Early Music Centre with Anthony Rooley, Jakob Lindberg, and Emma Kirkby. His study of historical performance practices led to the ability to play the lute with a softer 'no nail' sound and the guitar with standard concert guitar technique.\n\nIn 1980 he gave a critically acclaimed London debut which was described by GUITAR INTERNATIONAL magazine as: \"consistently clean and musical...he has a pleasantly relaxed stage manner which won over the audience right from the word go\". In addition to many concert recitals, he has performed at international guitar festivals in Toronto and Quebec and on CBC radio and TV. A strong advocate of new music and well as historical repertoire, he has commissioned and\/or premiered major works by many contemporary composers including John W. Duarte, Maximo Diego Pujol, and Canadians Stephen Chatman, Brian Tate and John Oliver.\n\nHe has released three solo CDs and one CD with the Vancouver Guitar Quartet that have received international critical praise. His latest solo CD 'The Golden Century-lute music of 16th century Italy' was released in Spring 2010.\n\nAlan Rinehart is a co-founder of The Vancouver Guitar Quartet that became a regular part of the Vancouver and Western Canadian music scene in the late 1980's with many concert and radio appearances including broadcast concerts on CBC's ARTS NATIONAL, and enthusiastically acclaimed performances as featured artists in the host pavilion at EXPO 86. After an hiatus of a number of years the Quartet reformed in 1996 and released its debut recording 'Estampas' in 1999. The Quartet disbanded in 2003.\n\nHis editorial work has included arranging and engraving the guitar performance edition of the Moscow lute manuscript of Sylvius Leopold Weiss for Editions Orphee and compiling and engraving a volume of music by Spanish guitarist A. J. Manjon for Chanterelle-Mel Bay as well as preparation of guitar solo and ensemble music for his own company NovaScribe Editions.\n\nHe was a faculty member of the music schools at the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Community College from 1983 to 2003.

Featuring music that may be enjoyed equally either as something pleasantly light in the background, or more attentively as something more serious and profound, this new album of music centered around the mid 16th century is performed on the viol (bowed like a violin or cello, but far more tender, placid, and humane) accompanied by the lute (plucked like a guitar, but more calm, courteous and modest) and, like a mesmeric, draws the listener into worlds that are almost unimaginable, and certainly almost forgotten.\n\nReview quotes:\n'This delightful album gives an insight into the special, ethereal world of serious music-making in the renaissance period. It is an intimate, sophisticated sound for the privileged, cultivated listener.'\nThe Viol\n\n'Recordings of later viol music often try to cover or minimize the sound of the articulation of the bow, but this recording embraces it as an essential and beautiful component of the music...the variety of colors that Alison produces from all the viols is astonishing..'\nViola da Gamba Society of America News\n\n'..a recording of sensitivity, clarity and warmth...the final track (Roy's Lullaby) creates a mood leaving us somewhere between a hypnotic trance and suspended in mid-air (making) the perfect conclusion to an imaginatively constructed programme, skilfully realised and expertly recorded.'\nThamesis\n",

        "bio": "Switch On: Rob Costlow explains the story behind the album\n\nSwitch On is the result of a collaboration with allMeadow, an artist based in Bristol (United Kingdom). He mixed the tracks, incorporated a ton of creative elements, and performed all the bass guitar parts. What else would you expect from a person located in the drum and bass capital of the world? Strangely enough, allMeadow and I have never met in person. However, a web cam, mic and today's other great technology enabled us to produce a professional full-length album. Oceans cannot stop our creative spirits. We're kind of star-crossed musicians. :) We met online back in 2005 via mutual creative interests. We're both very proud of this effort and hope it is enjoyed by music lovers around the world. Kudos to allMeadow and his genius mixing mind!\n\nSongs from all my contemporary piano albums were used to create the remixes. 7 of the 10 tracks are brand new. We included and remastered 3 tracks from my 2006 remix EP, Return. We felt they had to be added to the album flow as they fit so well with the concept. The very first track, \"Air Cooled\", is from a previously unreleased song I composed the parts for almost a decade ago. I'm quite happy to have it complete.\n\nThe music is intentionally quite different from my solo contemporary piano work (please note, I do plan to release more solo work). The album is filled with various tempos and instrumentation. The goal was to create a unique product that could serve many purposes, be it experimentation, entertainment, inspiration, or otherwise. The motive of the album is to stimulate and help drive a general sense of productivity. Hence, why the album is named \"Switch On\".",
